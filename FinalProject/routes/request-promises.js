/*
 Small demo to show chaining of API calls. We're using these APIs:
 https://weathers.co for current weather in 3 cities, and
 https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=<term> to search GitHub repos for
 the 'hottest' city. For example, we'll grab weather for 3 cities, pick the hottest one,
 then hit GitHub with a search for repos that have that city's name. A bit nonsensical
 but I just wanted to demonstrate using the results of one API call to populate a second.

 The problem we're trying to solve is that the API calls are asynch, and one of them
 (getCityTemperatures) loops through several asynch calls (one for each city), and they
 all have to complete before we go to the next step.

 Most of you will be doing something similar...make an API call, and then use the results
 in a second API call.

 request-promise-lite is a smaller version of the request-promise library. The 'regular' request
 package does not return Promises; several wrapper packages (like RPL) add native
 Promises so that we can chain them.
 The async package provides quite a few methods for managing asynchronous calls. We're
 using async.waterfall here which runs a series of functions in order, passing results
 to each one in turn

/*
 Only one route (http://localhost:3000/rp) for this demo. All this route does is log
 a message to the console and then start the asynchronous waterfall. The signature
 for async.waterfall is ([array of functions in order], final function (optional)

 In the waterfall, each function is passed a callback to the next function in the line,
 so in each function the last thing to do is call the callback, which expects an error
 object (which is null if there are no errors to report) and one or more parameters
 to hand to the next function.

 Once all three functions are done, a final function renders a Pug page with a table
 of results (yes, I know I said you have to use Angular for the front end...I used Pug
 here for speed and simplicity. YOU still have to use Angular.)

 That last function (function (err, result, city)) is called from the final function
 in the waterfall (findGitHubRepos), and then we just render a Pug page with the information.

 getCityTemperatures calls the weathers.co API for each city in a hardcoded array. This is the
 first function in the waterfall and so it receives only one param, the callback (cb).

 This is the most interesting function of the three because it has to do an API call for
 each city in the array, and they all are asynchronous. We can't return from the function
 until all of the city weather has been collected.

 In each API call, once the current temperature is known it is plugged into the city's object
 in the array.

 The technique here is to create a Promise that encompasses the API calls. That's the first
 return new Promise
 at the top of the function. A SECOND Promise is set up in the local function getWeather, and
 that's the one that does each city's API call. request.get() itself returns a Promise (because
 we are using the request-promise-lite package), and so we make the request.get() and follow
 it with a .then() which will run when the API call returns. The resolve() at the end of the .then()
 gets us out of this inner Promise and on to the next one.

 Now that we know which city is hottest, it is passed into findGitHubRepos (and
 of course we are given a callback to call at the end). This API is pretty simple,
 it just does a search for repos that have the string passed as the query string.
 GitHub requires a User-Agent header, and that is set as an option in request.get().
 The request returns a Promise and so is thenable, so we make the call, and when the
 results are ready an object is created for each item in the response (there are 30
 by default) with a few intersting bits of information. These are pushed onto an
 array that we'll return.
